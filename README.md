THE GAME

This game is a table with free places to go trough ('*'),
zombies that follow you ('Z') and
a goal: achieve the wall as faster as you can.
You can move using aqwedcxz or 47896321 intuitively. 

HOW TO RUN

The game is made to run in Linux distributions.
To run the game, first compile it. So you download the files, 
place them in a folder, open the folder on the terminal and
type the line bellow (never type the $):

$gcc *c -lm

so, I recommend you to, still in the terminal, type 

$pwd

then you copy it and type:

$./a.out the/output/of/pwd

Enjoy the game!
