THE GAME

This game is a table with free places to go trough ('*'),
zombies that follows you ('Z') and
a goal: achieve the wall as faster as you can.

HOW TO RUN

To run the game, first compile it. So you download the files, 
place them in a folder, open the folder on the terminal and
type the line bellow (never type the $):

$gcc *c -lm

so, I recomend you to, still in the terminal, type 

$pwd

then you copy it and type:

$./a.out the/output/of/pwd

Enjoy the game!
